## Project Design


#### Technologies will be used:

#### The Project's use cases

-  list **Create New Account:** 

Users who do not have an account in the website will be able to use this use case to create a new account so they can use the website's services.

- **Login To User Account:**

When the user first visits the website, the system will prompt the user to login to the master user account that controls other social media accounts. This use case will include another use case, which is Create New Account as an optional use case to make sure that users who have not registered in the website are able to create accounts through this use case.

- **Create Post:**

This use case is an important use case for this project because it is a big part of the idea of creating this project. Users will be able to use a text field to type their post and an image uploader to add an image to their post. When the post is created, the user will be able to publish the post to his/her account in the favorite social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and instagram.

- **Select social media platforms:**

This use case will allow the use to select the social media platforms where the post will be published. The Select social media platfroms use case should be used before, or after the post is created by the user. The post will not be published to social media if none of the check boxes was selected.

- **Create Social media account:**

This use case will allow the user to create an account in some of the social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and instagram using the "Social Media Manager".

- **View My Social Media Timelines:**

This use case will allow the user to view his/her timeline of all selected social media platforms on the "Social Media Manager" by embedding the pages or creating pages with user timelines using social media platforms APIs.
