# Social Media Manager

## Project Description

Social Media platforms became very popular since the last 10 years.

## Project Design


#### Technologies will be used:

- **Spring MVC:**
Spring MVC is a powerfull Java framework that helps in creating web application in an easy and convientient way. Therefore, this framework will be used in this project to create the structure and the functionality of the application. 

- **Bootstrap:**
Bootstrap is a powerfull open-source toolkit that allows developers to create responsive interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be used in this project in the fron-end. It adds an advantage to the application which is allowing the application to be responsive when minimizing the page, or used in phone web-browser. That increases the usability of the application as well as making it easy and interactive for users.

- **MySQL Database**
MySQL database is a reliable and powerful database that will allow the application to store user information such as usernames, passwords, posts, and logs. Therefore, MySQL database will be used in this application to ensure the presistency and reusability of the application.

- **Object Relational Mapping (ORM):**
The Object RElational Mapping is a technique that allows to convert and manage database data from an object-oriented programming. It allows the developer to easily store data and write queries and interact with the database using the programming language. Therefore, ORM will be used in this project to interact with the database using Java programming language.

- **Social Media APIs:**
Social Media Platforms provide APIs to allow developers to integrate their application with other services. Those APIs allow developers to pull information and verify users using the services that Social Media Application provide. Therefore, the APIs will be used in this project to authenticate users' accounts, create posts, view timelines and to call other services that could help users to manage their accounts. Those APIs provide different HTTP methods such as POST and GET allowing the application to interact with the Social Media Application.


#### The Project's use cases

- **Create New Account:** 
Users who do not have an account in the website will be able to use this use case to create a new account so they can use the website's services.

- **Log in to User Account:**
When the user first visits the website, the system will prompt the user to login to the master user account that controls other social media accounts. This use case will include another use case, which is Create New Account as an optional use case to make sure that users who have not registered in the website are able to create accounts through this use case.

- **Create Post:**
This use case is an important use case for this project because it is a big part of the idea of creating this project. Users will be able to use a text field to type their post and an image uploader to add an image to their post. When the post is created, the user will be able to publish the post to his/her account in the favorite social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and instagram.

- **Select Social Media Platforms:**
This use case will allow the use to select the social media platforms where the post will be published. The Select social media platfroms use case should be used before, or after the post is created by the user. The post will not be published to social media if none of the check boxes was selected.

- **Create Social Media Account:**
This use case will allow the user to create an account in some of the social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and instagram using the "Social Media Manager".

- **View My Social Media Timelines:**
This use case will allow the user to view his/her timeline of all selected social media platforms on the "Social Media Manager" by embedding the pages or creating pages with user timelines using social media platforms APIs.

## Project Schedule:

what will you have done at each checkpoint? What will the final project look like?

- **Checkpoint 1:**

-- Interface
-- Login
-- Database connection

- **Checkpoint 2:**
- **Checkpoint 3:**

## Project Justification:
.Novelty - why is your project different than existing applications, and why should people use it?b.
Complexity - why is this project a good showcase of your abilities?
